            <p>Then the ps3 controler came out which had the option of the controlers to be complete wireless from the console</p>

            <p>And then the ps4 controler came out which was much more comfortable and nicer to hold with new option called dual sesne which allowed you to move the controler and it made it move in the game, almost like the wii controller. </p>
            <img src="images/ps4.jpg">
            <p>The ps5 controler has a sleek new design easy to be held and it has the dualsense on it aswell with just a general nicer feel</p>
